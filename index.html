        <p>Hi there and welcome to my website, so to start off my name is Benjamin Diamond but you can just call me Ben.
        Many of my favorite things to do is playing video games, broswing the internet, and recently just got into Warhammer 40k (dont get into it, once you start you can't stop its a nightmare).
        Im still new to coding so this website might update from time to time to look better and better.
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to explore around and tell me if there is anything wrong.
